# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Twitter-using-Naive-Bayes

First of all we collect Datasets of Twitter and then doing a prepossessing on that data in which we remove extra part or extra spaces of data.Then we convert datainto a vectors to make data accessable or readable in where we use Sklearn count vectorizer to convert data into vectors and in the last we solve this by Sklearn naive bias and in which Sklearn is library and naive bias is machine learning algorithm. And in output we see the negative and positive comments or Twittes and where we also try to check positive and negative sentences.
